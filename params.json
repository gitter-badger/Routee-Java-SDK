  "body": "# Routee Java SDK       \r\n\r\nRoutee JAVA SDK provides the necessary classes to communicate with Routee Services. It currently supports all of the services offered by the Routee:\r\n\r\n  - Messaging\r\n  - Accounts\r\n  - Authentication\r\n  - Reports\r\n  - Two Step Verification\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\nRoutee Java SDK uses a number of open source projects to work properly:\r\n\r\n* [OKHttp] - An HTTP & HTTP/2 client for Java Applications - We use it to communicate with Routee REST API.\r\n* [JSON] - JSON Parser to convert responses from Routee API to JAVA Objects and vice versa\r\n* [Maven] - We use maven build system \r\n* [JUnit] - We use JUnit for unit testing the code - Tests have been written for the entire SDK.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nYou can either build the jar from source or use the existing jar included in the repository  (RouteeJavaSDK.jar). \r\n\r\nTo use the jar, simply include the jar file into your project, and add it to your build path. Than simply export the classes that you want to use.\r\n\r\nTo Build from Source:\r\n\r\nWe use Maven build system, you can generate jar by using the following commands:\r\n\r\nSimply go into SDK Directory (RouteeJavaSDK), and run the following commands\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ mvn dependency:resolve\r\n$ mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true install\r\n```\r\nFirst command is used to get all the dependencies for the project (OKHttp,JSON,JUnit). Second command will build the jar file from source code (The jar file will be located in target folder).\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nThe sdk has been thoroughly tested. To run the tests, simply type\r\n```sh\r\n$ mvn tests\r\n```\r\nPlease note that, you need to setup test environment prior to running the tests - You can do so my modifying the src/test/java/net/routee/TestConfiguraiton.Java File.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
